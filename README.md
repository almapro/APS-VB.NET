# APS-VB.NET
AlMA.PRO.SPY - VB.NET project  
  
### What's new?
- OfflineMode: Offline detection and workarounds (Brutal Kangaroo is coming).  
- RunTrick: Run trick is an error message that says "DRIVE:\PATH\TO\EXE is not a valid Win32 application" and looks real. To activate the RunTrick, you just need to prepend "RT-" (CaSe InsEnsiTivE) to the file name.  
- Melt: Delete the original file after first run. To activate Melt, append "-MELT" (CaSe InsEnsiTivE) to the file name (before extension).  
- DedicatedName: Name after first run. Change it in the "DedicatedName" variable.  
- Offline log errors: Before the "OfflineMode", once offline, always offline :')  
- Stable and way faster to connect. Plus, bugs fix.  
  
### What's to come?
- Brutal Kangaroo: The so called "CIA Hacking Tool", but just the functional part.  
- DPT: Determine Person's Type. This will study the user's activities and tell what type is he/she.  
- DIA: Detect Important Activities. If an important activity is ongoing, whether or not it's time to connect, the bot will log everything and send it to the server. If offline, it will store it and send it once online or a Kangaroo will have to stand for the mission.
